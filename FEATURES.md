# ASCII Art Generator - FEATURES

## Overview
The ASCII Art Generator is a versatile tool that converts images into ASCII art, offering both grayscale and colored outputs. Users can customize various parameters, apply filters, and download their generated art in different formats.

## Key Features

### 1. **Image Upload**
- Users can upload images in JPEG and PNG formats through a simple interface.
- Supports various image dimensions and aspect ratios.

### 2. **Grayscale ASCII Art Generation**
- Converts images into detailed grayscale ASCII art.
- Users can set the desired width for the ASCII output, maintaining the aspect ratio.

### 3. **Colored ASCII Art Generation**
- Generates ASCII art using HTML for colored output.
- Each pixel's RGB values are translated into color-coded ASCII characters.

### 4. **Customizable Width**
- Users can adjust the width of the ASCII art from 50 to 150 characters.
- Automatically scales the height to maintain the aspect ratio.

### 5. **Image Processing Filters**
- **Invert Colors**: Inverts the colors of the uploaded image for a different artistic effect.
- **Blur Filter**: Applies a blur effect to the image before conversion to ASCII art.
- **Edge Detection**: Highlights the edges in the image for a more defined ASCII representation.

### 6. **Download Options**
- Users can download the generated ASCII art as:
  - A plain text file for grayscale output.
  - An HTML file for colored ASCII art, viewable in web browsers.

### 7. **Responsive Design**
- The web interface is responsive and user-friendly, providing a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 8. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
- Fully functional command-line interface for users who prefer terminal usage.
- Supports various command-line arguments for customization:
  - `--width`: Set the width of the ASCII art.
  - `--color`: Enable colored ASCII art output.
  - `--invert`: Invert the colors of the image.
  - `--blur`: Apply a blur effect to the image.
  - `--edge`: Apply edge detection to the image.

### 9. **Error Handling**
- Robust error handling to manage unsupported file types and processing errors.
- User-friendly error messages for easier troubleshooting.

### 10. **Instructions and Documentation**
- Comprehensive user instructions embedded in the web interface.
- Detailed documentation available for both the web and command-line versions.

## Future Enhancements
- Addition of more ASCII character sets for varied artistic styles.
- Support for additional image formats (e.g., BMP, GIF).
- Integration of machine learning models for better image processing.
